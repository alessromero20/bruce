# FLW 02.1 // Code Along & Solo // Functions - No Parameters


## Code Along

### Create a function that multiplies a number by 2 and returns the multiplied number: 
1. [x] Declare a function and name it `multiplyByTwo`
2. [ ] Inside the function, declare a variable called `num`
3. [ ] Set `num` to equal the number 3
4. [ ] Multiply `num` by 2
5. [ ] Return the multiplied number
6. [ ] Save the function call `multiplyByTwo` in a variable named `result1`
7. [ ] Print `result1` to the `multiplyResult` div



## Code It Solo

### Create a function that returns a greeting to a person that includes their name:

8. [ ] Declare a function and name it `greetByName`
9. [ ] Inside the function, declare a variable called `firstName`
10. [ ] Set `firstName` equal to a string of your first name
11. [ ] Do the same, but for your last name
12. [ ] Use string interpolation to add a greeting in front of your name
      - Example: Hello, Hi, Welcome, Hola
13. [ ] Return the greeting and your name
14. [ ] Save the function call `greetByName` in a variable named `result2`
15. [ ] Print `result2` to the `greetingResult` div


## Challenge!
### Create a function that returns whether a person can vote based on their age. 

HINTS:
- Inside the function, set an `age` variable to number 18.
- You will need to use a conditional statement!
  -   If the age is equal to or greater than 18, "Go vote!" should be printed to the `votingResult` div. Otherwise, "Can't vote quite yet!" should be printed.
- Save the function call to a variable.
- Call the variable to run the function (no parentheses needed after the variable name!)
